  "description": "Replace digital clock with Analog Neon Clock for >3.4. Replaces the normal time/date but not the calender. Placement preference now available(except 3.8). Colors can be changed via css, for now I added color notes in the css, a preference to change themes will come soon.\n\nTodo: placement bug, Allow keeping time/date, add time to menu, color/size/thickness prefs/seconds optional.
